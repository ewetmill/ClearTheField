# ClearTheField
Clear the Mine Field is Java swing based game where you clear a field of hidden bombs.  When you clear a tile, it informs you of how many bombs are adjacent to it.  Can you clear the entire field?

## Building
If you don't have gradle installed, just run the gradle wrapper script.  After the build, there will be an executable jar file that can be run with no arguments.
